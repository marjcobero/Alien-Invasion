# Alien-Invasion
Alien Invasion is a game inspired from one of the classic games "Space Invaders". The backend is built with Pygame(Python).

# Features
* The player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen.
* The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar.
* When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. 
   * The player shoots and destroys the aliens. 
   * If the player shoots the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. 
   * If any aliens hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. 
   * If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
